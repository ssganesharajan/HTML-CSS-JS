    WE HAVE TWO TYPES OF components in react 
        1.functional component
        2.class component - not in use now.

    react function component is js function.

    JSX:
        javascript + XML
        html inside javascript 
            file extension: .jsx or .js

    <!-- component name - first letter should be uppercase -->

    Ex:js function returning 1 html element
    function Hello(){
        return <h1>hello world</h1>
    }

    Ex:js function returning multiple html element - must wrap it inside div
    function Hello(){
        return 
        <div><h1>hellooo..</h1>
        <h2>hellooo..</h2>
        <h3>hellooo..</h3></div>
    }

    import App(component name) from './App'(file name);
    export default App(component name)

component rendering
<App />
<Component1 />
<Component2 />
